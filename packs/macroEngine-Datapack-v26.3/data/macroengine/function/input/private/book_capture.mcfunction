# macroengine:input/private/book_capture  [INTERNAL — do not call directly]
# ======================================================================================
#
# Runs with @s bound to a single player holding the marked writable_book.
# Extracts SelectedItem.components."minecraft:writable_book_content".pages[0].raw
# into macroengine:input storage. Read-only capture, no execution.
#
# The book is NOT cleared. One-shot is enforced with a per-player debounce tag
# (macroengine.book_captured) so the same held book does not re-fire every tick.
# Tag is cleared when the player stops holding the marked book (see writable_book).
#
# book.raw is a RAW, UNVALIDATED string — same contract as cbm.command and
# dialog.raw. If the caller needs it as a number/bool/tag-safe literal,
# run it through macroengine:input/validate/check first:
#   function macroengine:input/validate/check with storage <yourpath> {source:"book.raw", type:"int"}
# ======================================================================================

# Already captured this hold-session — keep book, skip re-fire
execute if entity @s[tag=macroengine.book_captured] run return 0

data modify storage macroengine:input book.player set from entity @s UUID
