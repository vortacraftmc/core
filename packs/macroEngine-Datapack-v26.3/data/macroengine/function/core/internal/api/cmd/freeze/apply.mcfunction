# Runs AS the player to be frozen, AT their position.
#
# 1. Summons an invisible Marker armor stand at the player's feet.
#    Marker=1b means no hitbox and no tick overhead.
# 2. Copies the player's macroengine.pid to the stand's macroengine.freeze_id
#    so the tick function can match player↔stand reliably.
# 3. Tags both the stand (macroengine.freeze_anchor) and the player
#    (macroengine.frozen).
