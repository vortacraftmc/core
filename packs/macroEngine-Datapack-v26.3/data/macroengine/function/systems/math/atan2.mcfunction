# macroengine:systems/math/atan2 [MACRO]
# Integer atan2 — returns angle in degrees × 1000 (range: -180000..180000)
# Uses octant decomposition + lookup table (same scale as sin/cos: ×1000)
#
# INPUT:  $(y), $(x)  — integer coordinates (scaled consistently)
# OUTPUT: macroengine:output result — degrees × 1000
#
# EXAMPLE:
# function macroengine:systems/math/atan2 {y:500, x:500}
# → result = 45000 (45.000°)
#
# NOTES:
# - Both x and y zero → result = 0
# - Result matches standard math convention (CCW from +X axis)
