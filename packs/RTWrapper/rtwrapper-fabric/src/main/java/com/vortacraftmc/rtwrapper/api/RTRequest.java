/**
 * A single command request.
 *
 * Deliberately immutable and requiring a real ServerCommandSource at
 * construction time. This is the structural fix for the datapack's core
 * flaw: there, a request was just NBT written into rtwrapper:api storage,
 * with no origin/authority attached to it at all — any datapack, command
 * block, or /data modify from any player could write {cmd:"op", ...} and
 * the wrapper would run it.
 *
 * Here, you cannot build an RTRequest without a ServerCommandSource. That
 * source carries the actual permission level of whoever/whatever is
 * asking. There is no "trust the string" path.
