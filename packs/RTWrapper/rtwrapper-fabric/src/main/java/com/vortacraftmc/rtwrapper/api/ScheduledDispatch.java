/**
 * Delayed dispatch: run a request N ticks from now instead of immediately.
 *
 * Mirrors the intent of the datapack's `schedule function ... <delay>`
 * pattern, but without scheduling an actual function call — a task here
 * is just an RTRequest plus a target tick, held in a min-heap and drained
 * by RTWrapper's existing END_SERVER_TICK hook (see tick(long)). No new
 * tick listener is registered; this rides the one that already exists for
 * autotick, so the ordering already documented there (one queued autotick
 * request drained max per tick) is untouched — ScheduledDispatch has its
 * own, independent budget below.
 *
 * A tick counter, not wall-clock time, is used deliberately: server ticks
 * can run slower than 50ms under load, and "N ticks from now" is the
 * datapack-equivalent notion of delay (schedule's delay is also
 * tick-based under the hood), not "N milliseconds from now".
