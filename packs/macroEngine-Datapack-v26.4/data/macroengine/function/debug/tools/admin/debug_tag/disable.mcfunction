# macroengine:debug/tools/admin/debug_tag/disable
# Turns auto_debug_tag OFF: admins no longer get macroengine.debug
# automatically. Also strips macroengine.debug from every currently
# tagged admin so the effect is immediate, not just "stops granting
# new ones" — otherwise tags handed out by prior ticks would silently
# linger until manually removed, which defeats the point of disabling
# this.
#
# Use macroengine:debug/tools/admin/debug_tag/grant / revoke to manage
# macroengine.debug per-player once this is disabled.
