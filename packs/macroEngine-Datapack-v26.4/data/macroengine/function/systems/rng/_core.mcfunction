# Linear congruential generator, state = state * 1664525 + 1013904223
# (mod 2^32, which is what scoreboard overflow gives for free). The
# constants are the Numerical Recipes ones; the full 32-bit state is
# kept, and callers discard the low bits they do not trust by taking a
# modulus over the range they actually need.
