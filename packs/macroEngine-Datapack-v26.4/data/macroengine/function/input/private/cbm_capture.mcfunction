# Only reached when Command is confirmed non-empty and no pending capture.
# Runs with @s = the command_block_minecart.
#
# No executed:0b/1b flag anymore. The pending tag is set right before the
# handler call and removed right after, in the SAME function call — so
# there is no window where cbm_process on another entity could read stale
# shared state. Per-entity tag = per-entity debounce, no cross-talk.
