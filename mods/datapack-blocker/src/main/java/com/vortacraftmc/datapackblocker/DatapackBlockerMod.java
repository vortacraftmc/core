/**
 * Datapack Blocker - Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1.
 *
 * On {@code SERVER_STARTING} (before the world finishes loading), the
 * current world's {@code datapacks/} folder is locked down by
 * {@link AllowlistManager}: whatever is present the first time this mod
 * runs on a given world becomes the allowlist and gets its write
 * permission stripped; anything that shows up later and isn't on that
 * allowlist gets moved into quarantine instead of being left for the
 * server to load.
 *
 * See {@link AllowlistManager}'s class doc for exactly what this does and
 * does not protect against - in short, it's a tamper deterrent and an
 * "unexpected new pack" tripwire for a normal server-restart workflow, not
 * a hard security boundary against someone with direct filesystem access.
