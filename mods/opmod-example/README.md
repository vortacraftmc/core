# LevelOp

Fabric mod for Minecraft 26.3 that extends the vanilla `/op` command with an
explicit permission-level argument.

## What it adds

- `/op <targets>` — unchanged vanilla behaviour (grants op at the level from
  `op-permission-level` in `server.properties`).
- `/op <targets> <level>` — **new**. Grants op at the given `level` (1-4),
  regardless of the server's default `op-permission-level`.

Both require permission level 3 to run, same as vanilla `/op`.

## ⚠️ Known risk: Loom is pinned to 1.15.5

This subproject is deliberately pinned to `fabric-loom` **1.15.5** to match
the other subprojects in this monorepo (`mods/datapack-blocker`,
`examples/itemExampleMod`) and the root CI's Gradle 9.4.0. This was chosen
over bumping to a newer Loom for consistency — **but it means MC 26.3
support is not guaranteed** and needs verifying:

- MC 26.x ships **unobfuscated** (Mojang stopped shipping a Yarn-mappable
  obfuscation layer for these drops) — there is no `net.fabricmc:yarn` for
  26.3 to depend on.
- Loom only gained the ability to handle unobfuscated jars
  (`MinecraftJarProcessor.isUnobfuscated()`) starting at **1.15.5**, which is
  why 1.15.5 happens to still work here at all — it's the floor, not a
  comfortable margin.
- `gradle.properties` sets `fabric.loom.disableObfuscation=true` to tell Loom
  to skip mapping resolution. Because of this, `build.gradle` uses plain
  `implementation` for `fabric-loader` and `fabric-api` instead of
  `modImplementation` — with obfuscation disabled, Loom's remap-configuration
  setup (`RemapConfigurations.setupForSourceSet`) returns early and never
  creates the `mod*` configurations, so `modImplementation` would silently
  not resolve as expected.

If the build still fails after the fixes below, the most likely next problem
is that a *newer* Loom point release fixed something in the unobfuscated-jar
path that 1.15.5 doesn't have. If so, this subproject will need its own Loom
version bump independent of the rest of the repo (Gradle plugin versions are
per-subproject in a Groovy multi-project build) — check
https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom/releases between 1.15.5 and whatever
is current for anything mentioning 26.x/unobfuscated fixes.

## ⚠️ Known risk: mappings written against 1.21.9-1.21.11, not a real 26.3 build

MC 26.x ships **unobfuscated** — Mojang's own class/method names *are* the
compiled names, there is no separate Yarn mapping layer. That means the code
in `LevelOpMod.java` has to be written directly against Mojang's real names
(`CommandSourceStack`, `PlayerList`, `NameAndId`, ...) rather than the
familiar Yarn ones (`ServerCommandSource`, `PlayerManager`, `GameProfile`, ...).

I could not get access to an actual 26.3 jar or javadoc to confirm the exact
signatures against that specific build. What's in this file is confirmed
against Mojang mappings history through **1.21.11** (the last release before
the 26.x renumbering) — 26.3 is very likely identical or extremely close,
but two specific spots are flagged with inline `NOTE` comments in
`LevelOpMod.java` because Mojang introduced a new permission-level system
(`PermissionLevel` enum, `LevelBasedPermissionSet`) starting at 1.21.11, and
it's not confirmed whether it fully replaced the old `int`-based APIs by
26.3 or is running alongside them:

1. `CommandSourceStack#hasPermission(int)` — used for the `.requires(...)`
   permission check. Confirmed present through 1.21.11. If 26.3 requires a
   `PermissionLevel` enum value instead of a raw `int` here, this is the
   line to fix.
2. `PlayerList#op(NameAndId, Optional<Integer>, Optional<Boolean>)` — the
   overload this mod relies on to grant a *specific* level directly (instead
   of vanilla's `op(NameAndId)`, which always uses the server's
   `op-permission-level` default). Confirmed present in 1.21.9 through
   1.21.11. If 26.3 changed the middle parameter from `Optional<Integer>` to
   `Optional<PermissionLevel>`, swap `Optional.of(level)` for
   `Optional.of(PermissionLevel.byId(level))` (or equivalent).

If either has changed, the compiler error will point straight at the
mismatched line — this isn't a design problem, just two call sites that may
need a small signature update once you're building against the real 26.3
jar.

## ⚠️ Known risk: Loom is pinned to 1.15.5

This subproject is deliberately pinned to `fabric-loom` **1.15.5** to match
the other subprojects in this monorepo (`mods/datapack-blocker`,
`examples/itemExampleMod`) and the root CI's Gradle 9.4.0. This was chosen
over bumping to a newer Loom for consistency — **but it means MC 26.3
support is not guaranteed** and needs verifying:

  (`MinecraftJarProcessor.isUnobfuscated()`) starting at **1.15.5**, which is
  why 1.15.5 happens to still work here at all — it's the floor, not a
  comfortable margin.
- `gradle.properties` sets `fabric.loom.disableObfuscation=true` to tell Loom

  `implementation` for `fabric-loader` and `fabric-api` instead of
  `modImplementation` — with obfuscation disabled, Loom's remap-configuration

  creates the `mod*` configurations, so `modImplementation` would silently
  not resolve as expected.

If the build still fails after the fixes above, the most likely next problem
is that a *newer* Loom point release fixed something in the unobfuscated-jar
path that 1.15.5 doesn't have. If so, this subproject will need its own Loom

https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom/releases between 1.15.5 and whatever
is current for anything mentioning 26.x/unobfuscated fixes.

## Before building

1. Confirm Fabric Loader / Fabric API versions are still current on
   https://fabricmc.net/develop and https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api —
   this project was written against Loader 0.19.5 and Fabric API
   0.161.0+26.3. Specifically check that whatever Fabric API build you pick
   for 26.3 doesn't itself require a newer Loom than 1.15.5.
2. You'll need JDK 25 installed (Minecraft 26.3 requires it).
3. Skim the two risk sections above before your first build — they tell you
   exactly what to check if `./gradlew build` fails.

## Build

```
./gradlew build
```

The mod jar will be in `build/libs/`.

## Notes on implementation

- No mixins are used. The mod registers an *additional* branch under the
  existing `op` command literal via `CommandRegistrationCallback`, so vanilla
  `/op <targets>` keeps working exactly as before.
- Unlike the mod's first draft (which used Yarn-style `PlayerManager` +
  reflection to overwrite an ops-list entry), this version uses
  `PlayerList#op(NameAndId, Optional<Integer>, Optional<Boolean>)`, which
  grants the requested level *directly* — no reflection, no re-writing
  `ops.json` after the fact.
